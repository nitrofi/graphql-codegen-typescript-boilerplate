# graphql-codegen-typescript-boilerplate

Minimal GraphQL tooling boilerplate with GraghQL Code Generator for Typescript that is easy to adapt and expand for any workflow.

> Uses [SpaceX GraphQL API ðŸš€](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) as an example endpoint. Replace `env` variables with your own endpoint and token if needed.

## Main features ðŸ”¥

- GraghQL Code Generator configuration

  - Generates raw output for types and graphql operations for a more minimal approach
  - Generates `TypedDocumentNode` for use with most GraphQL clients
    - [See libraries supporting TypedDocumentNode](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-typed-document-node#built-in-support)

- VSCode plugin config for GraphQL
  - GraphQL: Language Feature Support (`GraphQL.vscode-graphql`)
    - config in `./graphql.config.js`
    - `.env` file support in config
  - GraphQL: Syntax Highlighting (`GraphQL.vscode-graphql-syntax`)
- Simple tesing environment to easily test generated graphql operations and types and expand to use GraphQL client libraries on top of `TypedDocumentNode`

## Files and folders

- `.env.example`
  - environment variable example
- `.nvmrc`

- `codegen.yml`
  - Config for `@graphql-codegen/cli` and related plugins
  - See codegen plugin related documentation in `codegen.yml`
- `graphql.config.js`
  - Config for VSCode plugin: GraphQL: Language Feature Support
- `index.html`
  - Easily test generated graphql code in browser environment with VSCode live server
- `tsconfig.json`
  - TypeScript compiler options. Should also work with default config as created by `tsc --init`.
- `.vscode/extensions.json`
  - recommended extension needed by this boilerplate
- `src/index.ts`
  - Inline GraphQL operation examples
  - Used by `index.html`
    - Easily test generated graphql operations and types
- `src/generated`
  - contains all code generated by codegen per endpoint
- `src/gql-operations`
  - GraphQL operations defined in `.graphql` files
- `src/utils/fakeTag.ts`
  - exports `fake-tag` that is used to wrap GraphQL string operations
    - since this project doesn't use a bundler, `fake-tag` is used here "inline"
- `lib/`
  - contains all files compiled by `tsc`

## Usage

# Copy env file and replace
cp .env.example .env
# Set correct node and npm version
